# EleunameBotConsole
### Console adaption of a desktop application.

Note: this project was just a test but I am happy of how it turned out. I was tired of having to constantly run an app on my streaming computer, so I just wrote a .NET Core C# Application for my Linux server so I would have it up 24/24. It is buggy and messy so feel free to contribute/report bugs!
